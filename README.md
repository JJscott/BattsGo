# BattsGo Theme for Sabaki

A theme with meme stones and other gems (soon to come) for [Sabaki](http://sabaki.yichuanshen.de/).

## Installation

Download the theme file `battsgo.asar` (or pack it yourself) and install it directly inside Sabaki under 'Preferences' > 'Themes' > 'Install Theme...'.

Packing
Make sure you have [node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)  installed. If you don't have `asar` installed already, run:

```
$ npm install asar -g
```

To pack your userstyle into a theme, run the following command:

```
$ asar pack ./theme ./battsgo.asar
```

`battsgo.asar` will be created and is ready for distribution. It can be installed in Preferences.
